        <h4>2. General information and mandatory information</h4>
        <h6>Data protection</h6>
        <p>
          The operators of this website and its pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. Hence,
          we handle your personal data as confidential information and in compliance with the statutory data protection
          regulations and this Data Protection Declaration.
        </p>
        <p>

          information is collected.
        </p>
        <p>
          We herewith advise you that the transmission of data via the Internet (i.e. through e-mail communications) may
          be prone to security gaps. It is not possible to completely protect data against third party access.
        </p>
        <h6>Information about the responsible party (referred to as the “controller” in the GDPR)</h6>
        <p>The data processing controller on this website is:</p>
        <p>
          Semiodesk GmbH<br />
          Werner-von-Siemens Str. 6<br />
          Building 15K<br />
          D-86159 Augsburg<br />
          GERMANY
        </p>

        <p>
          Telephone: [Telefonnummer der verantwortlichen Stelle]<br />
          Email: hello@semiodesk.com
        </p>
        <p>
          The controller is the natural person or legal entity that single-handedly or jointly with others makes
          decisions as to the purposes of and resources for the processing of personal data (e.g. names, e-mail
          addresses, etc.).
        </p>
        <h6>Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</h6>
        <p>
          A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject to your express consent. You can also
          revoke at any time any consent you have already given us. To do so, all you are required to do is sent us an
          informal notification via e-mail. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data collection
          that occurred prior to your revocation.
        </p>
        <h6>
          Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to object to direct advertising (Art. 21
          GDPR)
        </h6>
        <p>
          <strong
            >In the event that data are processed on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. e or f GDPR, you have the right to
            at any time object to the processing of your personal data based on grounds arising from your unique
            situation. This also applies to any profiling based on these provisions. To determine the legal basis, on
            which any processing of data is based, please consult this Data Protection Declaration. If you log an
            objection, we will no longer process your affected personal data, unless we are in a position to present
            compelling protection worthy grounds for the processing of your data, that outweigh your interests, rights
            and freedoms or if the purpose of the processing is the claiming, exercising or defence of legal
            entitlements (objection pursuant to Art. 21 Sect. 1 GDPR).</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >If your personal data is being processed in order to engage in direct advertising, you have the right to at
            any time object to the processing of your affected personal data for the purposes of such advertising. This
            also applies to profiling to the extent that it is affiliated with such direct advertising. If you object,
            your personal data will subsequently no longer be used for direct advertising purposes (objection pursuant
            to Art. 21 Sect. 2 GDPR).</strong
          >
        </p>
        <h6>Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</h6>
        <p>
          In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to log a complaint with a supervisory
          agency, in particular in the member state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at the
          place where the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a complaint is in effect regardless of any other
          administrative or court proceedings available as legal recourses.
        </p>
        <h6>Right to data portability</h6>
        <p>
          You have the right to demand that we hand over any data we automatically process on the basis of your consent
          or in order to fulfil a contract be handed over to you or a third party in a commonly used, machine readable
          format. If you should demand the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will be done only if
          it is technically feasible.
        </p>
        <h6>SSL and/or TLS encryption</h6>
        <p>
          For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as purchase orders or
          inquiries you submit to us as the website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption
          programme. You can recognise an encrypted connection by checking whether the address line of the browser
          switches from “http://” to “https://” and also by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.
        </p>
        <p>If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
        <h6>Information about, blockage, rectification and eradication of data</h6>
        <p>
          Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right to at any time demand information
          about your archived personal data, their source and recipients as well as the purpose of the processing of
          your data. You may also have a right to have your data rectified, blocked or eradicated. If you have questions
          about this subject matter or any other questions about personal data, please do not hesitate to contact us at
          any time at the address provided in section “Information Required by Law.”
        </p>
        <h6>Right to demand processing restrictions</h6>
        <p>
          You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as the processing of your personal data is
          concerned. To do so, you may contact us at any time at the address provided in section “Information Required
          by Law.” The right to demand restriction of processing applies in the following cases:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data archived by us, we will usually need some
            time to verify this claim. During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right to demand
            that we restrict the processing of your personal data.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful manner, you have the option to
            demand the restriction of the processing of your data in lieu of demanding the eradication of this data.
          </li>
          <li>
            If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to exercise, defend or claim legal
            entitlements, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead
            of its eradication.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21 Sect. 1 GDPR, your rights and our rights will have to be
            weighed against each other. As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the
            right to demand a restriction of the processing of your personal data.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data – with the exception of their
          archiving – may be processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal entitlements
          or to protect the rights of other natural persons or legal entities or for important public interest reasons
          cited by the European Union or a member state of the EU.

          certain functions you want to use (e.g. the shopping cart function), are stored on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1
          lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in storing cookies to ensure the technically error
          free and optimised provision of the operator’s services. If other cookies (e.g. cookies for the analysis of

          6 Sect. 1 lit. a GDPR). You have the right to revoke at any time any consent you have already given us. To do
          so, all you are required to do is sent us an informal notification via e-mail. This shall be without prejudice
          to the lawfulness of any data collection that occurred prior to your revocation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The information you have entered into the contact form shall remain with us until you ask us to eradicate the
          data, revoke your consent to the archiving of data or if the purpose for which the information is being
          archived no longer exists (e.g. after we have concluded our response to your inquiry). This shall be without
          prejudice to any mandatory legal provisions – in particular retention periods.
